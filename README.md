The idea behind this project is to have a hassle-free cross-platform clipboard
I imagine something like this already exists in Apple's ecosystem, but I have a Windows laptop, and Android smartphone and an iPad, so I'd like to make this thing really universal
In a perfect world, it'd be nice to have some kind of shared clibpoard and the only thing you have to do is to copy on one device and paste on another
But I don't know other ways of doing this other than having an app running in background which doesn't sound plausible for an app which will be used a couple times a day

I did a basic copying logic in Go, but struggled with porting it to mobile. If I ever come back to this one, I either find a way to port it to Android using Go tools or try something different, like Flutter
